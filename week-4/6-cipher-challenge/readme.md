# U2.W4: Pair Cipher Challenge (Mandatory pairing challenge)

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Decompose a problem into smaller, easier to solve components
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code

## Summary
The N.S.A. just broke Kim Jong Un's cipher that he's been using to give instructions to his military commanders! We wrote the following program to decipher the messages. As the N.S.A.'s best programmer on staff, your job is to refactor the code.

In this challenge, you'll work with a pair to refactor some existing code to make it more readable and follow ruby best practices. Then you will compare your solution with the other pair(s) in your accountability group.

## Release 0: Run the code
See what the expected output is.

## Release 1: Write tests
Use [driver test code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md). What can you rely on? What can't you rely on?

## Release 2: Read the code
Identify what each line of code is doing. It's located in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.
Write comments next to or above each line with an explanation.
Really focus on breaking each step down. You want to understand every line.

NOTE: You do not need to understand each part of lines 68 and 69. These lines use regular expressions that look for one or more of any digit. You don't have to refactor these two lines.

## Release 3: [Refactor (by rewriting) the initial solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)
  - Clean up the variable names.
  - The original code used a hard-coded hash to do the encryption. Can you create a simple algorithm instead? The original shift was by 4 characters. What would happen if it was changed to 10?

## Release 4: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Push your changes
(Push your solution) to Github, then email your code to your accountability group.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
Review the other solutions in your accountability group. Were the solutions different? What did the others do well or better than you? What did you do well? Comment on each solution. Arrange a half hour discussion to discuss your different approaches.
