# Ruby Algorithms

So you've done some preparation on Ruby, and have probably been wondering "Why did we have to do all those exercises before Phase 0 if we weren't even going to start with Ruby?" Well, now is your time to get back to it while while maintaining your blog and using the git skills you learned in unit 1.

Unit 2 is organized differently from Unit 1. We don't provide reading resources specifically for challenges or units, so it's up to you to review or research concepts in Ruby you need to work through these challenges. We highly recommend selecting a Ruby book from the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/resources.md) to reference as you go through these challenges. You'll want to have a good understanding of the Ruby language. We often recommend the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*, which is not free, but we have arranged a 45% off discount with [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/black3/) Use code `rubycl14`. **Please respect future students and Dev Bootcamp by not sharing this code or the ebook with others. This code is for Dev Bootcamp students only.**

This week you will be working on writing command-line programs focusing on algorithms and basic testing. Some challenges will also have tests already developed using RSpec (a tool for testing ruby code). You will learn how to run these tests on your computer and read them to decide whether you've successfully solved the challenge. NOTE: You are not expected to fully understand or write any RSpec in Phase 0, just be able to read it. RSpec is designed to be readable.You should have installed RSpec in Unit 1, so there is no need to re-install.

**Please make sure to follow each step we ask you (in order): write driver test code, pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring, reflection, and review.**

This week you get a bit more choice on which challenges to do. If you want to go above and beyond, do all of them!

If you are using the *Well-Grounded Rubyist*, you'll want to look at Chapters 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. You don't need to read every chapter thoroughly, skim where you need to. Take more time with concepts you don't know.

## Challenges

## Remember your Expectations for the Unit!
- Pair at least twice this week.  (You need to pair 6 times this unit.)
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. You need to submit at least 7 pieces of feedback in this unit. (6 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS.)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. (You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.)

## Working through the Challenges
- Fork this (phase-0-unit-2) repository by clicking "Fork" at the top right of the page.
- Enable "issues" in the settings for the repo, like you did for phase-0-unit-1. This will allow people
  to give you feedback.
- Clone the `phase-0-unit-2` repository from the command line to your computer.

You will want to run and modify all files from your local repository on your computer. Use the terminal to navigate to the 'my_solution.rb' files or the spec files.

## Submitting your work
It is not enough to push your changes to your fork on GitHub,  you'll need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There is a "Unit 2 Week 4 Submission" form.

We use the submission form to gather feedback on our curriculum, so please answer the questions honestly to help us make the program better.

## Fetching Changes
Sometimes we will make changes to the original repository to clarify instructions. You will need to fetch these changes from the master branch when we announce changes on the google+ community. Use [these](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) instructions. **Substitute phase-0-unit-2 for each instance of phase-0-unit-1 in the instructions.**
