## Release 0: Create the Template

Create a new HTML file in your blog-posts [USERNAME].github.io website. Name it `week6_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`.

## Release 1: Research

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation?

## Release 2: Blog it!

In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?

Go into as much depth feels comfortable for you.
